# 💤 LazyVim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim setup built on top of LazyVim.  
It includes custom keymaps, plugin configurations, and workflow optimizations designed for a fast and productive development experience.

## Features

- Built on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- Custom keybindings for efficient navigation and editing
- Optimized plugin management and performance
- Integrated tools for modern development workflows

## Installation

> **Important:** If you already have a Neovim configuration, it's recommended to back it up first.

1. **Backup your existing config (optional but recommended):**

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_backup
```

2. **Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifenfisaha/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

3. **Open Neovim to automatically install and configure plugins:**

```bash
nvim
```

## Uninstall / Remove this configuration

If you decide this setup isn't for you and want to revert back to your previous configuration:

1. **Remove my configuration:**

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
```

2. **Restore your previous configuration (if you backed it up):**

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim_backup ~/.config/nvim
```

```

```
